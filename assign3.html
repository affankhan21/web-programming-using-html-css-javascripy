    <h4>Web Development </h4>
    <p>
        Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps.
        
        Think of all the web pages you have used over the years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.</p>

        <h4>Web Development as an industry </h4>
        <p>Since the mid 1990s,web development has been one of the fastest growing industries in the world.In 1995 there were fewer than 1000 web development companies in the united states,but by 2005 there were over 30,000 such cpmpanies [citation needed] in the Us alone.The growth of this industry is being pushed by large business wishing to sell products and services to their customers and to automate business workflow </p>
        <h4>Security Considerations</h4>
        <p>
            Web Development takes into account many security considerations,such as data entry error checking through forms ,filtering outputand encryption.Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge of web development as a whole.
